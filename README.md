Squeak
======

>Python library for processing and analysing data from mouse tracking psychological experiments.

Squeak is a collection of functions which I've developed to analyse psychological mouse-tracking data in python.
It's very much a work in progress, and at the time of writing consists of two branches:

- [master](../tree/master), which is the last fully functional, tested version of the software, and
- [dev](../tree/dev), which contains much more recent code, but may not be 100% reliable.

As the code is still undergoing major changes as I collect and analyse more data for my PhD, this package is for tinkerers and those generally interested in the underlying code, rather than anyone looking for a polished, ready-to-use solution (for which I recomend [MouseTracker](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~freemanlab/mousetracker/).
